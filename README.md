through these tasks, I’ve gained a lot ofexperience and improved my understanding of web development. Here's what I learned:

- Writing clean and structured HTML code
- Styling webpages using CSS (colors, layout, fonts, and responsiveness)
- Adding JavaScript (form validation, sidebar toggle, etc.)
- Creating pull requests (PRs) with proper commit messages and descriptions.
- How to push changes to GitHub and manage tasks with branches and PRs.


- I have created 3 separate PRs:
  1. HTML Task PR
  2. CSS Task PR
  3. JavaScript Task PR
